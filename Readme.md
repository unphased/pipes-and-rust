# Remarkable Tablet Canvas

Very simple tool to draw pen input to a browser window for sharing. Runs on the desktop, nothing to install on the ReMarkable.

Copies pen strokes, not the contents of the screen, but that's fine for live-sharing sketches.

Tested on a Mac, Linux probably works fine. Captures data via `ssh`.

## How to use

You'll need to do a little bit on the command-line. Assuming you have Python 3 installed.

Setup:

1. Set up SSH private keys and config so that running `ssh remarkable` succeeds. This works both via wifi and USB connection.
    -  If you want to connect via WiFi you will need to retrieve the IP address from the help screen.
    -  If you want to use it with the wired connection, use the IP address `10.11.99.1`.
2. Install the requirements for the python script that runs on your computer:
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To run:

1. `./run`
2. Visit <http://localhost:6789/>

Press 'enter' to rotate the canvas. Press 'space' to clear the canvas.

## Why?

For quick whiteboarding screenshare. The other solutions didn't quite work for me. 

 - The official one requires an account so I never tried it. 
 - [reStream](https://github.com/rien/reStream) captures the framebuffer but in the latest ReMarkable firmware crawls, giving about 0.5 fps.
 - This requires no compilation or execution on the tablet.

And I wanted a little project. Part of the reason I bought this tablet was the ability to hack it.

## How does it work?

The Remarkable tablet has access to the binary event stream for its input sensors in `/dev/input/event0`. It also allows SSH access. This streams the sensor data over SSH, parses the binary stream and sends it over a websocket to a browser.

The browser has some rudimentary smoothing, plus hover indicator.

## Smoothing

The data from the digitiser seems to zig-zag. This is subtle at slow speeds, but quicker strokes really show it up.

So the data is smoothed in a small averaged ring-buffer. Press `d` in the browser to toggle debug data points.

## TODOs and limitations

This was a one-evening hack. But it's promising.

1. Proper axes and scaling.
2. Capture hardware keys as well to clear screen.
